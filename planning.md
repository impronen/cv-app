## Planning for CV App

### Components

What we need(not in order):

1. Education section
2. Experience
3. General information
4. Skills

Each of these need to have state with all the properties that I want them to contain + similar editing flag that is false/true based on whether we are editing or not. Similar methods of changing things as with any class based thing, just with setState.

We'll start with just making stuff that does the thing - renders them components etc. Think after that if you want to go with something like Tailwind or MUI

Tailwind: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
MUI https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/

If you end up implementing the PDF thing, look into https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF
