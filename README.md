# CV App

A simple REACT CV app, where the user can input basic details, education and professional history. These are rendered in real time to the right side of the page.

As my first "real" React project, this was mostly me learning to think in a new paradigm after spending quite a bit of time with vanilla JS and OOP paradigm. The lesson prompt is from the old React course from The Odin Project, which still started with class based components.

I soon found the use of classes in React to be frustrating and opted to refactor it to functional components even before the app was functional. Thinking in terms of functional programming and with React concepts like state and props was challenging at first but the React teams great documentation helped a great deal.

I also tested deploying with Vercel, after using only GH Pages earlier.
